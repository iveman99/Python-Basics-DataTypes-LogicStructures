# 🧠 Python Basics: Data Types, Logic & Data Structures  

> **"Making Data Speak"**

### ✍️ Scribbled Logic — My Raw Thought Process  
> My mind doesn’t code before it scribbles.  
> Before automation begins, I build chaos — with arrows, notes, and half-baked loops.  
> Every polished script begins as pages of rough logic, sketches, and curious “what ifs.”  

This notebook marks the start of my **Scribbled Logic** journey — where I translate my raw, handwritten logic into structured Python code.  

Because before my AI agents start reasoning, I do.  
And it all begins here:  
➤ with **data types**,  
➤ a few **if-else decisions**,  
➤ and the building blocks of **data structures** that make logic come alive.

### 🧩 About This Series
This is part of my **Scribbled Logic** learning series — documenting my journey from fundamentals to building intelligent systems and AI agents.

> Before it becomes a workflow or an agent, it’s just an idea fighting for structure.
